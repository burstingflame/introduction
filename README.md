BYI :
I act like a teenager online, trust me I am not trying to be like Diddy 2.0. I can get very socially awkward in real life. I will block you if I don't like you, you don't like me and/or my friends, or you're below 14. You might encounter me in Pony Town, I don't really bite so go ahead and say hi! I'm also short-tempered and easily agitated on certain situations. I have diagnosed social anxiety.. I forget to use tonetags since I don't really need them, inform me if you need tone indicators, I'll gladly use them. There are times where I'm jokingly mean, tell me when to tone it down! I make KYS/KMS jokes around friends I know they're okay with the jokes.
